 1. Compose a script to show below system information for your Linux Ubuntu VM. Use Formatted text. 

Kernel Release
Bash Version
Free Storage
Free Memory
Total Files in any pwd ( Create Random Files )
IP Address

2. Compose a bash script to print your Birthday as well as add all the digits of your birthday and print them too.

3. Compose a bash script to send a test e-mail with any attachment (can be zip, png, jpeg etc any format type) to your northeastern e-mail id. 

4. Compose a bash script to install putty on your remote Linux ubuntu machine and test ssh connection of a remote server. ( You all have to test the same server machine that you created for your 2nd Assignment ). Additionally perform a reboot of your remote server using another bash script once the ssh connection is established. 

 
5. Compose a bash script to allow a user to enter a postal code of USA and Canada and the script should validate/print the country name (whether USA or Canada or none) by checking postal code. Regular expression can be used to check conditions. Note: Canadian postal code is six character alphanumeric string (e.g. V5K0A1) and USA has only numerical digits (e.g 02155). 

6. Compose a bash script to create a table and query your table with your first name, last name, Date of birth in MYSQL database. 


7. Compose a bash script to create AWS IAM user (user123) in your AWS account. Kindly make sure you are deleting your IAM user through GUI after it is created successfully and tested out.


8. Compose a Bash Script to Change an Amazon EC2 instance type. (The type can be changed to any version)

For this question, you would first need to create t2.micro EC2 instance that is your free tier through GUI and then change the type of your EC2 through your script.

Also you might also need to install AWS CLI on your base machine so as a HINT, I would recommend to go through AWS Documentation docs/templates for the same.
